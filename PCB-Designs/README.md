# 3D-Printed Mods
  I bought the LS210 frame for my quadcopter and I made some upgrades for
this frame. If anyone wants the models to print for themselves
they will available for download on my <a href="https://github.com/MitchellStride/Quadcopter/tree/master/3Dprintedmods/Models">github</a> when finished. I also posted the .SLDPRT if someone wanted to improve them. I haven't printed and tested them all yet so they are not finished, only modelled.
<p>
 The Headset and Gimbal models can also both be found in the same folders.

## GOPRO Top Mount
I designed this mount to record better quality footage with my fathers GoPro.
The gimbal is more for photography style flying.

## Landing Gear
I created this to make it easier to takeoff on non flat surfaces. It will also add the
space and protection required to mount the gimbal I plan to make.

## Propellor Guards
I am still learning to fly, this will protect my propellors and the surroundings. g

## Better Side Panels
I was going to design my own but I found a model on thingiverse with a similar design I was
thinking off so instead of reinventing the wheel I may try

## FlySky FS-i6 Guard
To protect the sticks on my new radio I modelled a small guard for them.

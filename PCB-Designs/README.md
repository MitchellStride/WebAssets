## STM32F303 Module w/ CAN
Reusable drop in board I made for Paradigm Hyperloop. Used my favourite family of microcontrollers the STM32 line. I have made a few designs similar to this, I need to work on my programming skills.

## STM32F070F6Px
Cheapest board I could make with USB support and some other basic peripherials. I added catellated pads myself with a dremmel later.

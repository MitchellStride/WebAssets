# Product Pages

The following sub pages are from my product datasheets and showcase for my junior design project. Neither project is technically advanced but it was fun to put them together with a partner and friend. They both had a wide range of fun tasks such as winding our own transformer, solidworks modeling, 3Dprinting, and PCB design.
